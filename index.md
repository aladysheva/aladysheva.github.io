## Welcome to my website!

<div class="begin-examples"></div>

## The Markdown
We'll abuse some Markdown elements to get the layout we want. You can choose to style your page differently, but here we'll have code examples on the right, and code explanations on the left.

### First, we need to tell Markdown where the two column layout begins.
Anything before this element will be rendered normally.

```
<div class="begin-examples"></div>
```

And we should also tell it where the two column layout ends.

```
<div class="end-examples"></div>
```

### `h2` will be an example section header.

<div class="end-examples"></div>

I am a development economist and senior researcher at the [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute](https://www.sipri.org/), working in Peace & Development cluster. I am also a research affiliate at the [International Security and Development Center](http://isdc.org/). My research interests span from impact evaluations in developing countries to African pre-colonial development and the impact of Soviet policies on contemporary Russian development. Currently, I work on two large impact evaluations of peacebuilding programmes in Kyrgyzstan and a Panel Study [_Life in Kyrgyzstan (2010-2016)_](http://lifeinkyrgyzstan.org/). I did my PhD at the [Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies](http://graduateinstitute.ch/home.html) in Geneva. I worked for the World Bank on the impact evaluation of community monitoring in health and school facilities in Burkina Faso.
