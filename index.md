## About


Welcome to my website!

I am a development economist and senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, working in Peace & Development cluster. My research interests span from impact evaluations in developing countries to African pre-colonial development and the impact of Soviet policies on contemporary Russian development. Currently, I work on two large impact evaluations of peacebuilding programmes in Kyrgyzstan and a Panel Study _Life in Kyrgyzstan (2010-2016)_. I did my PhD at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. I worked for the World Bank on the impact evaluation of community monitoring in health and school facilities in Burkina Faso.
